They were telling me false information but me being the young college kid I am, I didn't know what was the truth and what wasn't. Alice made the process quick and easy with lots of help also from Ms. Anna, of course. They made sure I was going to get taken care of. The case was suppose to drag out for another year but instead it only took about 3 months. We settled on a good amount and I could not feel anymore content.

They have represented me in a highly acrimonious divorce involving significant custody and property issues. I have been very pleased with the outcomes, but even more so with the firm's approach: very professional, prompt, thorough, communicative, and detail-oriented. Their communication has been outstanding, keeping me informed of everything and responding very quickly to my inquiries. Throughout, I have felt that they were listening to my priorities and that I was fully in charge of the process. I use the word ""team"" advisedly: it is not just the attorneys, but also their fellow professionals such as forensic accountants, plus the outstanding administrative staff, which makes for a formidable combination.

Concerning cost: good legal help is not cheap, but W&P were very clear up front about what the case might cost, have been careful to explain the additional costs that might be incurred by certain moves, have provided carefully itemized statements, and have been judicious about not arguing certain points of the case when the possible gain wasn't worth the cost to me.

I have heard many horror stories from people who went through mediation or had inferior attorneys, and ended up with unsatisfactory outcomes; I am very grateful to be represented by Wilson & Pettine. I have recommended this firm to several other individuals who were, unfortunately, in need of similar legal assistance, and will continue to do so.",5,"It was with great interest that I read a recent google review post on the Wilson & Pettine web site.  I have been a client of Wilson & Pettine, and particularly Paul Pettine, since 2006.  My case was very contentious and complex, involving a business, separate property claims, fraud issues and child related matters.  I have two children and currently have sole legal and physical custody because of Wilson & Pettine.   Right from the beginning Wilson & Pettine was up front and realistic regarding the potential fees that I could be facing.  Their fee estimates were correct and their analysis of the case proved accurate.  All the attorneys at Wilson and Pettine handled my initial divorce matters in a professional and exemplary manner.  During my initial divorce matter, I was involved in a child custody evaluation which is extremely complicated and emotionally draining.  The attorneys guided me through every aspect of the procedure with the skill and support that only highly experienced professional are capable of.  They strategized and executed how best it would be for my business to survive during the divorce and helped me keep my business during the property division.  Most importantly, they understood the financial aspects of divorces, even recognizing there may be fraudulent accounting issues by a third-party accountant.  Post-judgment they helped me negotiate the difficulty of custody/visitation issues, eventually leading to sole custody of my children.  I have recommended many friends to Wilson & Pettine and have never heard an ill word about their ability or handling of a client.  In my business I interact with many attorneys on a weekly basis and few have shown the professionalism and dedication to their clients that Wilson & Pettine does.",5,"For the first time in over a year and half and several attorneys later, I have an attorney accompanied by a team of support staff that is not only phenomenal at their job but return calls, are accessible, and care genuinely about their clients. 
Before Paul represented me, I was at such a loss with the first two ""highly recommended"" attorneys. I was underrepresented with the first, and then overcharged with the second without moving forward. Paul has demonstrated genuine results and clearly knows what he is doing. My only regret was not finding Paul sooner, but glad I had the bad experiences if for nothing else than to have complete faith in this firm now knowing the differences.
I have actually seen more progress in the last two months than I have in the last year and a half. Paul may not have restored all of my faith in the legal system but now I am beyond confident that he will do all he can within his power to see that I am properly represented and am treated as fairly as possible in a clearly inequitable legal environment. I thank Paul and the firm for their fearlessness and willingness to not only take my case but put all of their heart and soul into it.",5,0,

I had no health insurance and I lost my job as a result of the accident. I sustained head, neck and back injuries. I worked with Attorney Vincent-Pope and her Paralegal, Ms. Townsend for close to two years. I could have never handled all of the work with the other insurance company on my own. Judy and Rhonda became like family to me.

Whenever I had questions, or needed details explained to me they were happy to help. The accident was hard for me physically, emotionally and financially. They understood how life was harder for me after the accident and made many accommodations. When my case came to a close in 2014, they helped me settle with my creditors and negotiate reasonable payments for the care I received.

I am happy that I chose this firm to represent me. I would recommend them to my friends or loved ones in a heartbeat. ",5,"I was struck by a pick-up Truck while riding my bicycle. I suffered numerous severe injuries which required a prolonged stay in ICU along with months of rehabilitation and recovery. The subsequent bills and expenses were extensive, and I strongly believed that I was not at fault. The Insurance company of the driver of the Truck that hit me refused to accept liability for the accident. It soon became apparent that I would need legal representation if I hoped to claim the settlement which I felt that I deserved to cover my losses and medical expenses.
 
I contacted a number of Law firms, including many large, publicized, and heavily advertised firms. Though, initially they all were willing to review my case, some even going as far as to investigate the accident, none felt it worth their time, expense, or odds to take on the case. You see, North Carolina is one of only a few Contributory Negligence States instituting regulations which, to a degree, favor the Insurance industry in cases where responsibility is not 100 percent clear. The fact that I was on a bicycle when I was struck only served to cloud the responsibility that much more. I had all but given up hope of receiving any settlement at all when by chance I met Judy Vincent-Pope.
 
I simply cannot offer Judy and her staff enough praise!!! Her professionalism, dedication, and dogged determination are unmatched in the legal field, and I myself, come from a long family line of attorneys. Mrs. Vincent-Pope never backed down, thoroughly researched and pursued my case, took a very personal interest in me, maintained open communications, and showed the utmost respect for my concerns. Mrs. Vincent-Pope won full settlement for me, but more importantly, she allowed me to regain my dignity, and for that, I am forever grateful. I highly recommend the Vincent-Pope Law Firm above all others in cases which involve accident injury.",5,,5,0,

Anytime I had an issue, concern or question with my case, Mr. Claery or his associate attorneys, were available to answer my question or address my concerns.

Throughout my case, Mr. Claery was always meticulously prepared. He handled my negotiations and the detailed documentation preparation in a manner consistent with the highest business standards.  As we went to court he provided a clear agenda of my case, while the other party was trying to confuse and prolong the case, Mr. Claery pushed forward through this nightmare.

The police arrested and charged the criminal but his defense attorney filed a private complaint against me resulting in myself, despite being listed as the official victim, being charged with Assault & Battery (serious injury) which is a felony. At the time I was a student 1 year away from graduating with a doctorate degree. I did my research on what attorneys were available to me and saw that Attorney Salerno had a large number of positive reviews as well as many years of experience as a state trooper. I reached out to his office and was talking to Attorney Salerno in no time at all. Mr. Salerno walked me through the Magistrate Clerks hearing (cannot stress how important it is to have an attorney present for this step) and made sure that it was recorded and later used as evidence in my favor at the trial. He then proceeded to speak to the prosecutor, police officers/detectives, and relevant witnesses. At my trial he made the accurate determination of what choice I would be better served by (judge or jury) and then proceeded to thoroughly, systematically, and intuitively cross examine and tear apart my accusers testimony. The judge ruled NOT GUILTY. I cannot thank Attorney Salerno enough because as a result I can apply for my professional license, apply for a job, and apply for anything that requires a background check without fear of being rejected. His pricing is also fair and I was charged a flat fee. There were no surprise charges or billings. If you are being accused of something that may result in a criminal record (even if it is just for an appearance before a magistrate clerk), I highly recommend you give Attorney Salerno a call",5,"Excellent representation .  . . Caring, altruistic and benevolent man. I could not recommend a better attorney. He took my situation during the holiday season personally and gave back a third of my fee. He came to my aid despite the fact we couldn't afford the additional costs. He knows the DA's on a first name basis AND he's located directly across from the Worcester courthouse. He even took the time to talk to several other people awaiting arraignment. By the way, he got my case dismissed. BONUS. Thank you so much Mr. Salerno.
Attorney Salerno benevolence extended far beyond my wildest dreams. He actually got wind of a bench warrant, that I had no idea about, and took care of it for me with no strings attached. (Meaning free of charge) He ALSO took care of my court fee on top of being altruistic to refund me money for the holiday season. He IS MY ATTORNEY FOR LIFE. I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR HIM AND HIS TEAM.",5,Mr. Salerno is a great attorney.  Having him as counsel was the best decision ever!,5,0,sub_9PblaJPCIqyCMI

Upon graduating from USC School of Law, Sahm took an associate position at Tharpe & Howell LLP where he specialized in defending persons through their insurance companies who had caused trucking and auto accidents. Thereafter, Sahm took an associate position at Wilson, Kenna & Borys LLP where he represented business establishments that had been sued by persons that had been injured while on their property, Thus, Sahm represented companies and individuals through their insurance companies against persons that had been injured. This representation provided Sahm the invaluable experience of learning how insurance companies functioned, defended claims, and valuated injuries. This experience was invaluable to providing Sahm the insight to present our injured clients' claims to the same insurance companies that Sahm once represented. In 2006, Sahm left Wilson, Kenna & Borys, LLP to start his own personal injury practice and to use his experience and knowledge to represent injured persons.

The receptionist makes you feel very at home and comfortable and once you walk in there you are instantly friends with all of the staff. They are each extremely warm and that really makes you feel at ease when having to deal with issues involving the law. They know you are stressed and really go out of your way to make you feel as relaxed as possible.

I found myself in a situation I never thought I would be in, and was charged with a felony in an unrelated incident to the custody case. Lies from ""witnesses"" were stacking up against me, it was a no-brainer; David was the man I was going to trust with my life. I was facing prison time if convicted, I was worried I was going to lose more than just my children.

David not only allowed me to make payments to him, but never hounded me about the money. He worked very hard for me and ended this process within months; not years!

If you find yourself jammed up, do yourself a favor and please go talk to him. He truly is a man who cares! And yes, that charge went away just as fast as it arrived, David got it expunged from my record and helped me through this process.

He would take my calls just to let me vent. He kept me informed with all of my legal matters and was eager to get both cases resolved as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately her health deteriorated and she was unable to continue to work and support herself. As her son living in Connecticut, there was little else I could do but to support her financially myself. I did this for several years, but this became a financial burden on me as I make a modest income.

I was advised that my best recourse would be if my mom became a citizen. Unfortunately, my mom's command of the English language and my command of the Spanish language was poor. Moreover, I did not have the time or knowledge to navigate the legal system in Georgia, remotely from Connecticut, to get her the proper application paperwork for citizenship.

This is when I became extremely fortunate to find Ms. Fernanda Hottle through an online search of immigration lawyers near Atlanta that could speak Spanish. Ms. Hottle, it turns out, is tri-lingual and speaks Spanish and Portuguese as well. I had a consultation call with Fernanda and explained my mom's situation that she was elderly and needed more hand-holding than usual. Fernanda understood and advised me of our options, timelines, and costs associated with engaging her services.

I was convinced after my consultation call with Ms. Hottle that she was the right attorney that could assist my mom. She met in person with my mother to explain to her in Spanish what she needed to know about the process. She made my mom feel at ease and that was a major requirement I was looking for in an attorney.

Moreover, when faced with the knowledge my mom would have to pass a citizenship exam, I reached out to Fernanda again for any referrals she knew of that could tutor my mom with studying for the exam. Fernanda reached out to her own assistant, Jocelyn, who graciously agreed to tutor my mom for a fee. With Jocelyn's assistance, my mom passed the exam with flying colors and she became a naturalized US citizen with access to social security benefits that have greatly decreased my monthly subsidy to support her financially.

Lastly, Fernanda dedicated time off of her very busy schedule to provide pro-bono assistance with helping my mom find state-funded housing for disadvantaged seniors. She personally accompanied my mom to visit and help her apply to several communities and is now on a waiting list.

None of the above could have happened without the assistance of Fernanda, and I am incredibly grateful for everything she has done for me and my mother. If you are looking for an attorney that conveys professionalism, attention to detail, patience, and responsiveness, look no further than the Hottle Law Firm.",5,"After the complexity of the process I realized how much you need a lawyer, super professional lawyer, attentive, highly recommend.",5,,5,0,sub_9bbAOD3ggGIYSi

I must say spending another 40 - 50k and firing one attorney who was almost paid up was a very hard decision. Marcos and his team made my mind up for me at 6:30 am the morning after I called. At that hour there were 4 lawyers in an office listening to my story. I could immediately feel that Marcos was concerned with all the right things. I have had the best lawyers represent me numerous times in Atlanta. I know what good lawyers say, I know how they act, and I know what is real and what's fake. Marcos blew me away!! Fast forward almost 2 yrs : I received a prison sentence that was unheard of given given the circumstances. I've had a little baby girl during the wait for sentencing, my main goal was to get out before she would ever remember. Marcos made that a reality. For that I am forever grateful. This man truly saved my life folks. There is not a court setting too big for Marcos Garza, he owns the show. After sentencing, I had to get my thumbprint taken by the U.S Marshalls. Keep in mind that they see every lawyer, and every sentencing in eastern Tenn. Two of them told me "" Sir, your lawyer just saved your tail"" ."" Marcos Garza owned that courtroom for 6 hrs"" . These guys were floored at what they had witnessed at an all day federal sentencing hearing. I would never go into to court without Marcos again. I can honestly say that he cares for his clients. I've seen the guy shed tears reading character reference letters written on my behalf. If you are wavering on a lawyer for any case, go see Marcos. He will treat you like his family. I consider him a friend for life.",5,Mr.Garza is a straight up man he will line up the facts and get to the bottom of ur case. He is a all star in the courtroom let him take control over ur hearing and he will knock it out of the park for you and make it a homerun!!! He definitely won't lead you in the wrong direction and will work hard for you. I'd say overall my experience was pleasent with him and he has strongly worked with me and made the process a lot easier. I will say he is worth the little extra money vs the other guys just ask ur self do you want a superstar or the average Joe. There was very little I wasn't pleased with but I couldn't honestly believe anyone else could have gotten me a better deal! This man got a felony and several misdemeanors off my back and for that I truly thank him. You rock Garza let no one tell you otherwise ur my go to guy!,5,,5,0,sub_9eaigIUZsjs8HZ

I knew choosing my divorce attorney was going to be a huge, life-altering decision, (after all, (obviously most importantly) custody of my kids and my assets were on the line) so I devoted a TON of time and research into making my decision the right one. Christopher immediately stood out during our consultation as extremely bright, knowledgable, experienced, savvy, patient, quick to answer every question with in-depth responses, understanding of how upset I was but informing me of the process, up-front/honest about some of the challenges we might face regarding my case (no sugar coating), and remarkably kind. I researched him at nauseum and found nothing but excellent client and peer reviews prior to hiring him. The aforementioned qualities did not change or fade one bit during my entire experience and time with Christopher and his availability and communication was always top-notch. Christopher's going to tell you what is best for you as his client, even if it's not what you want to hear because you're angry, irrational, or spiteful. He had a way of refocusing me on our long-term goals during my times of anger, feeling hopeless, and irrationality during my divorce--that was really important in retrospect. Divorce is a terrible thing to go through, no matter who you hire, but I know I was extremely lucky to have Christopher's experience, knowledge, and reassuring/kind nature on my side. The fact that he's a remarkably kind, caring, and decent man is icing on the cake; it just so happened the brightest and best attorney I could find had those qualities. Again, I was very lucky to find him. Christopher was seemingly one step ahead of my wife's attorney at every turn. He will fight for you and he's VERY sharp and bright. He's truly excellent at what he does. I never hesitated to contact him with questions or concerns, but ultimately I let him utilize his expertise in the decision making department; something I'm so glad I did now that reflect on my experience. Going through all that I did without his experience, extraordinary expertise, and calming presence by my side is unimaginable in retrospect. Divorce is terrible, no couple thinks it's going to be them. However, it happens and you're going to need a great, not good, attorney fighting for you when it does--and Christopher is amazing at what he does. Needless to say, I'm very happy with the outcome of my case. I can't recommend Christopher enough.",5,,5,,5,0,sub_9ebZXkpGvHvHjB

When you hire her you are hiring a team that has excellent relationships with the court, they have a great grasp of the law, and in the odd event that something happens to your attorney she transitions a temporary replacement or is even ready to step in herself if need be.

However I must stress to all people who are using an attorney for the first time. Make sure you are certain what your goals are, clearly express what you want to your attorney, communicate timely with your attorney, and listen to the advise that you are paying them for.

Too often I think people don't think what they want through entirely and couples that have broken up have broken up because of poor communication skills.

As a parent going through divorce or custody you should not expect your attorney to hold your hand, but you damned sure better make sure that you can communicate with your attorney better than you did your ex. If you are willing to be patient, listen to your attorneys advice, and lucky to find a team as competent as Janice's you have better chance than most.

This is one of the few attorneys I have met that I might support running for judge, but competent enough where I suspect that one day we will find her having built one of the largest smoothest running firms in the Midwest.

* Mr. Caivano exemplified professionalism and friendliness, and made me feel very at ease throughout the entire process.

He always helped explain in layman's terms so that I had a full understanding before proceeding with each step.
* Upon my first visit with Mr. Caivano, I shared the details of my personal injury.  I was not only impressed with his respect for me and empathy for what I was going through, but also of the extent of his detailed knowledge of the human anatomy and medical procedures.
* Mr. Caivano and his office staff have incredible organizational skills, and they were easy to reach by telephone or email, and served me with prompt responses to any inquiries that I had or to keep me informed on the status of each step along the way.  I received reminder calls when I was scheduled for an appointment not only with them, but also for appointments with the doctor who I was required to see to verify my injury.
* Mr. Caivano helped me to settle this case for the maximum award amount possible and then helped to negotiate with the insurance company multiple times to minimize what I had to repay.  He did not back down when they asked for far more than he felt reasonable, and continued to mediate until an agreement was reached.
* This case settled very smoothly and quickly.
* I highly recommend Mr. Caivano based on the exceptional representation I received.  I hope to never have to utilize his services again simply because I pray to never be so injured ever again as the result of someone else's negligence!",5,0,sub_9ewYv5x0VA2hsM

At the time I was facing a terminal illness, and on-going discriminatory treatment at a local university. It was my third year as a Higher Education Administrator, and my 16th year in Academia. I had arrived in Miami with a stellar work history, and now my work, my integrity and my newly diagnosed illness were being attacked almost daily. On several occasions, I was told to seek legal advice. It was a difficult decision to make, as I felt somewhat defeated. I was facing a work climate of abuse, secrecy, nepotism and blatant and on-going discriminatory treatment. 
I had to do something. I was referred to Gina. As soon as I entered Gina's office, and met with her, I felt a sense of hope, even though I wondered whether she would believe what I found was an insurmountable reality. I worked in a climate where daily abuse, and a lack of tolerance for the realities of my disability were intentionally swept under the rug. After sharing my story, it was clear to Gina that my disability was a bone of contention for my Employer. 
Gina believed me, and empowered me to reflect on my situation, and continue to work with the same commitment, work ethic and respect for my colleagues, in the hope that the abuse and discrimination would end. Gina informed me that there appeared to be a collective attempt to terminate me. She warned the employer of clear violations. In fact 6 months later I was terminated. Never once having been approached by HR to seek clarification despite their knowledge of what was taking place. It was an unbelievable experience for me. 
During every step of the process to seek redress, Gina remained accessible, she kept me informed and continued to recognize that I was wronged, and discriminated against as a result of my disability. 
We were given the right to sue by EEOC on the grounds of a clear violation of ADA/Human Rights. In the final outcome, I was made whole. I cannot thank Gina enough, she is compassionate, insightful, well versed in the legalities, has integrity, honesty, and an ability to empathize and empower. Gina is committed to combat workplace discrimination and address inequities. She is a quiet force. 
My word for Gina is GENUINE. 
My case was resolved in September 2015. I have since referred two colleagues to Gina.",5,,5,,5,0,sub_9gpduuYIk6OgkP

Being a lawyer is beneath him.

When my employer was making my life hell on Earth, I felt so helpless. I had to have called up 10 lawyers. I dealt with so many who didn't talk to me straight.

This guy actually read through my stuff. Frankly his consultation on its own gave me more time than lawyers I hired.

Every other lawyer blew me off and didn't even care to look over my stuff. One even agreed to get me on a phone call, but ended up just flaking even having a consultation - Even *after* I took 30 minutes to fill out a form for him! Yeah! I think I'll be reviewing that guy next!

Now it's time to reward the good guys though.

Frankly I am a chicken dealing with lawyers. I'm not familiar with it. I could probably program the next big thing some day but the law to me is a bunch of wizardry.

I ended up chickening out and not going through with the severance agreement. When I wrote the company lawyers a big letter to them about what I got put through they responded (in substance):

The company disagrees with your points and doesn't want to discuss the matter this time.

Kind of like how I came in at 5 AM to program my companies software. How I stood there and dealt with bullying behavior by people who, in fact, had little clue of the subject at hand were NOT senior. I was programming in the work force programming and only dropped out to do a summer program sponsored by Google. Do they care what I sacrificed for them? I hardly took a day off! Other's went to Hawaii! I stayed weekends!

The manipulativeness of the CEO - after all my sacrifice - he even manipulated the staff to just reject my box I had mailed to me at the office. For a coffee machine I paid by hand for all to use. As if my own *taint* was a scar on the company.

The CEO even bragged to his friend about how, in our performance reviews and private talks, he deliberately tried to push and stress me.

Corporations that act like a parasite at the blood of an honest worker destroy the trust we have in things. The ideals that make labor actually work. What a toxic CEO.

Want to know how to fix things? You clone an army of Arlos.

You are completely screwed if you don't have someone on your side!",5,Attorney Arlo Uriarte has handled many of my legal concerns from consulting  to my personal injury.  His team works so efficiently and is always available when I reach out to them.  They handled my case diligently.,5,"I was so grateful to have both Arlo and Brent review my situation and help me decide how best to address my employer after being laid off. Not only did they provide me with a complimentary consultation, but they were extremely professional and thorough in offering options and suggestions. In fact, Brent is one of the few lawyers I believe genuinely was on my side. 

I would definitely recommend Brent and Liberation Law Group to anyone who thinks they may have been unlawfully treated or discriminated against.",5,0,sub_9mUII4AFHb7A0A

Barbara was by my side the whole time. She communicated with me constantly and even called me on the weekends if she needed to.  She always made sure to answer my questions and make sure I UNDERSTOOD the answers.  She was delicate in delivering the hard truths that I needed to hear.  My trial was 13 days long!  She was a force to be reckoned with in the court room.  I was in great hands with Barbara and I am happy with the judge's decision.

I went to Gerald for assistance with my DUI case. Gerald was very up front with me and managed expectations very well without sugar coating it too much. I have worked with other lawyers who I feel tell you what you want to hear in order to get your business but don't give you a realistic picuture of what can be done. This is not the case with Mr. Stahl. He was forthright and spoke candidly. He constantly kept in contact with me and did a phenomenal job keeping me in the loop and returning/answering all of my calls. He was always prompt and prepared for my court dates and his fees were more than reasonable. That being said it is hard to put a price on freedom and no matter what he charged I feel it would be fair for the service and representation I got. In the end Gerald exceeded my expectations and my case was dismissed. This turned out better than either of us thought it would. Underpromise and overdeliver. That's his motto.,5,"Gerald is THE absolute Best!!! I had heard great things about him and I'm so thankful I called him!!

I called Margaret Fernandez.

Margaret was very strategic. She thought about my case in ways that I had never thought about it. And she explained how critical it was that we win.

Margaret prepared me and showed me which facts in my case were important.

Most importantly, Margaret is a great coach. She got my head in the game. She is strict and disciplined. At first, she seemed harsh. She actually shouted at me to shut up a few times when she was preparing me. But I needed that. I was lost and rambling. I was in fear and denial. That shock helped me. Once I did what she said, and stopped thinking my way, and instead started thinking her way and doing what she said, my case came together.

Margaret carefully and patiently negotiated with the other side (they were completely arrogant and would not back down at all), but based on her recommendation, I decided to go forward and try the case.

She said that she will not take or push a case that she does not believe she cannot win. Also, now that I understand what all goes on, I know that the price was extremely fair.

When Margaret showed up in that courtroom, she was respectful, quiet, and humble, and she took control. I could see that Margaret respected the Judge and that the Judge respected Margaret. Margaret is a lady.

Margaret tried the case and won.

When I say that Margaret won, I am telling you she beat the other side like a congo drum, up one side and down the other, and at first the other side did not even know it was happening. At the end, when the smoke cleared, the other side could not have imagined how bad the outcome was going to be.

Margaret is a very quietly strong private person. In the beginning, when she pushed me, it upset me. But in the end, I understood that she was helping me to clear out the wrong way of thinking, to help me to get to what was really important in the case, and that she was completely dedicated to me, and was vested in my victory. One of the ways she wins is to help you change your way of thinking.

Margaret Fernandez and The Fernandez Law Firm are the very best in Atlanta. She is the best, she cared about me, she is beautiful, she made me think properly, she went to the mat for me, she is not afraid of anyone or anything, and she always keeps a cool head.",5,"The Fernandez Law Firm is the best business law firm in Cumming, Georgia and the best business attorneys in Forsyth County.

We saw many lawyers and firms, before deciding to use Akin Law group. Most firms we saw tried to scare us with doomsday scenarios and crazy retainers.  During our initial consultation Mr. Akin was able to communicate the breadth of the case, without over dramatizing. We felt comfortable with Mr. Akin and decided shortly after to retain his firm for our defense. Shortly after our follow up meeting we received regular communication for Mr. Akin via phone and email with updates on the case. We were very pleased with the outcome. What I liked most about the whole situation is during the initial conference, Mr. Akin explained how the whole case would play out from start to finish, now that the case is over I can say that it played out exactly how he said it would. One of most important things you should look for in an attorney is experience the fact that he was able to anticipate the other attorney was going to do is priceless.  The only reason I gave Akin Law group five stars is because I can't give six.     ",5,"I m working with Mr Akin More then a 12 years now and i can tell everyone to feel comfortable to hire them because they do work all the cases very professional and they take their time to understand you and make sure you get what you want ..  

Mr Akin and his friends are very good people and very professional and really good price to :)

I would highly recommend this firm to anyone that deserves justice and need help 

They will always on your side....

To start I have three separate businesses that do three different things. There are human resource, legal, and tax impacts to what seems like every decision made. My approach to many challenges sometimes involves what some may consider abstract or unconventional solutions. Many attorneys that I have hired in the past can write a contract or set up an LLC, but when I need to discuss out of the box ideas in my businesses they seemed to be lost.

I originally engaged Bill Bronchick in 2010 to understand Owner Finance Real Estate transactions better. At the time I was very impressed with his understanding of complex real estate transactions. Since then I continue to have Mr. Bronchick as a key member of my team to this day. He consistently provides me with fresh perspective to the daily challenges that I face while giving legal guidance to make sure that unconventional approaches remain legal. Mr. Bronchick has an incredible way of understanding my goals and providing me with guidance to accomplish those goals while simultaneously keeping me out of a bad legal position.

Since originally hiring Mr. Bronchick to help me in my real estate business I credit his advise and help with allowing me to complete millions of dollars in real estate transactions while generating consistent six figure profits.

The real estate business is dynamic and changes Country to Country, state to state, City to City, and many times Neighborhood to Neighborhood. I have sought Mr. Bronchicks guidance across all of those spectrums and he consistently comes through for me.

If you are in need of an attorney that understands your asset protection, real estate, and tax planning needs I highly recommend that you hire Mr. Bronchick to help you.",5,"Bill Bronchick and his team are extremely helpful for investors from beginners to seasoned experts. They educate by giving all the answers you will be asking for and then go beyond to provide insights gained from thousands of transactions in real estate. From basic landlording to creative financing and overall financial strategies, they have been invaluable to me and I have referred them many times to my friends who are looking to maximize their returns safely inside and outside their retirement accounts. Thank You!",5,Really brilliant lawyer.  Did a closing with him that no other title company or lawyer knew how to do in Colorado.

I can only imagine what will come of my other case. His assistant Gloria, was amazing. She made sure all documents and medical  records were organized an bills separated by each accident and itemized.  Larry and Gloria made my part effortless and put up with my silly  questions.

They arranged additional medical reviews, kept me informed of the other side's actions, made clear to me which laws gave them the confidence that we were going to win. Adam used his vast medical contacts and the firm's assets to build my case. He was honest from the very start that because of my pre-existing conditions it was going to be a long process, so the firm helped me make some sound financial decisions a long the way to keep my family afloat. Of course he won a large settlement for me and my family, and his post-settlement suggestions (which financial firms to look at to invest the bulk of the settlement) were an added bonus. Along the way Adam became my friend. I continue to go to him for legal advise on other matters, and his referrals have been equally assessable and competent.

We left for a 25 day trip leaving our beloved furbaby names Meera with a pet sitter. We had used the service of the pet sitter before. Unexpectedly, the pet sitter put us in a very difficult, scary situation and told me she no longer knew how to handle our beloved Meera! Meera was like a child to us, we often interchanged her names with our children. I did not want to leave her with a kennel and chose a pet sitter that came with rave reviews. Three days into the trip, she insisted she had no idea how to handle Meera even though she had taken care of her. Being out of the country and knowing we would not have internet connections all the time as we travel throughout India, I made a decision to have Meera be transferred to a place I had rescued her from. Unfortunately our beloved Meera ran away and died! I received a text from a stranger that our Meera was on side of a road, dead and I needed to get her off the street! We made quick arrangements. I contacted the original pet sitter and asked her before finding out Meera died if she would refund the money that was owed for the service not provided. The pet sitter outright said no, and presented us with false bill to a vet trying to extort us. 
When we met Mr. Turner and explained our heartbreaking situation, he was beyond compassionate, kind, patient and easily accessible. He was extremely detailed oriented, firm and made our trauma a bit less in helping us do the right thing! Not once did he discouraged me in pursuing what I felt was to do the right thing as a matter of principle and make the pet sitter accountable! He not only displayed his compassion for our beloved Meera and my family, he guided me through some tough times as I would contact him and ask questions in a process which I wanted to speed up! He was always always available! I knew from the moment I met him and his team, he would help me bring this matter to a closure! It took few months, but his professional, easily accessible, kind and compassionate way of handling our situation gave me a closure which I was looking for mentally and within my heart! I am extremely thankful for all Mr. Turner and his team did! I was able to move on, my children were able to move as well as my husband! He gave me a closure to a very traumatic, painful, gut wrenching pain I have never felt for our beloved Meera! The matter was settled! I cannot thank Mr. Turner enough! My family thanks you!

Michael ended up dropping some of my charges and I have received only probation when I was expecting to go to prison for at least few years. Michael helped me to finish probation early from 5 years to two and half and also he helped me to expunge my record. He saved my life and helped me to start a new life. He is a wonderful, intelligent and the best criminal defense lawyer I've ever encountered in my life. I can honestly say if you hire Michael Kraut you are making the best choice in your life. Thank you Michael for helping me to start my life! If it wasn't you I would be in prison right now. I appreciate you so much.

",5,"Michael Kraut and the Kraut Law Group are beyond exceptional. I was in a time of need and was seeking a lawyer. I read the MANY fantastic reviews of this lawyer and decided to shoot him an email. He immediately replied and offered to help with my case. He is very quick, efficient and successful. He conducted himself in a very professional way and it required minimal effort from my side. He took care of everything and was 100% successful with my case. I HIGHLY recommended him and will continue to share his success with anyone in need of a fantastic lawyer. Thanks so much!!!",5,"I have been unable to challenge the nursing board to obtain my licensure because of my two DUI convictions.  This placed me in a professional rut for five long years. As one can imagine, this was demoralizing, and at times, I felt I was disempowered to move forward.  

I hired Michael because I saw that he was confident and entirely committed in advocating for my case, where I at times was finding myself lacking in confidence. He is sharp, direct, knowledgeable, and perceptive - qualities that I look for with an attorney who understands any case or obstacle that is thrown at him. 

He fought to expunge my most recent DUI conviction, and with great news, the expungement was granted. I have much more confidence in my application with the nursing board thanks to Michael.  If you are looking for someone who will empower you, fight for you, and win, he is your man.",5,0,sub_CLb5npkCqRIxve

I never felt alone at any point in this ordeal. Believe me that is very important during the ordeal that going to court can be. Mr. Crow went out of his way to call around and find me a place to serve community service rather than spend time in jail.  At the sentencing he articulated all the points we had discussed and I was VERY pleased with the outcome given what the DA was asking the judge to do.

He explained in complete detail what would transpire from day 1 to the end of the case and it was 100% accurate! I have yet to deal or even speak to another attorney that handles his clients with such respect, compassion and transparency! Jim, you really made me feel as if I was one of your number one priorities every time we spoke, and every time we had to show up in court. My case lasted just over 2-1/2 years and I feel like I got to know you on more of a personal level, rather than just an attorney-client relationship! My case has been completed and I didn't get to really thank you in the way that I wanted to. That was because I was still in shock from the outcome.

Such as being required to have a job as conditions of release but suspending her drivers license, then arresting her for driving without a license and revoking her probation etc... And how the charge used to implicate her in a federal trial had nothing to do with the case and was out of jurisdiction.

He worked tremendously well (using his Harvard education) enhancing my local counsel in Colorado with his excellent leadership helping the productivity of the time spent in the local court. I have been through a highly litigated divorce/battle for over 7 years as the result of trying to exercise my minimal court ordered time with my children against horrible opposition. I have never felt the court has completely heard my side or ruled in any way to assist me with this until now. 
My children have been severely alienated and were used as weapons by their mother. It has been her goal to undermine, brainwash, lie, and do everything in her power to try and stop me from my weekend visitation with my children. She has used the school, church, friends, public court system, child protective services, restraining orders and numerous false police reports in attempt to achieve this and was very close to getting this done. Through the past three years I was reported to child protected services 9 times unfounded. These reports were carried out by a violence advocacy group counselor 6 times, 3 times by the mother and her friend's. Previous court orders have only empowered the mother of my children to do this. When David entered my case in May of 2012 my oldest son was refusing to see me and the younger two were in the process of doing the same. From that time to date there were emergency motions to stop my vacation time with the children twice, once from the mother and once from a biased anti dad child legal representative. 
All denied by a very wise magistrate. This would have never happened if David Oles didn't intervene with motions and repeals to protect my parenting time. In the final hearing there was contempt along with a motion to modify. David Oles went against 3 female attorneys (2 that specialize in high conflict custody from Denver) and a CLR (who was extremely biased against me) all with the goal to diminishing my time with the children to supervised parenting time and tripling my child support. They combined had twice the court time that we did. Under severe time constraints David got all the important evidence that the magistrate needed to hear and crossed every important point leaving the mother the liar that she is, exposing the un-ethical counselor for what she was and discrediting all of their witnesses. The opposing party had us two to one and left with their heads hanging and the truth prevailed which is not easy in this kind of case. 
Thanks to David working with and leading local counsel, my parenting time is significantly increased and the following has been ordered to happen. The court has found alienation to exist by the mother (doesn't happen often in my county). 
My child support didn't change in fact went down a little. We won a sanctions/contempt with double the make-up time and attorney's fees. The un-ethical counselor was rejected by the court (no longer aloud to see the children and found to be coaching the children practicing dual relationships) with enough evidence to go after her legally if necessary. The mother is required to get therapy with the threat of custody change if she continues this behavior. 
I feel that David E Oles is not just an attorney. He is an attorney that truly has found his niche or calling in life. He commands a presence against all odds in stubborn courts that have a hard time with doing things out of the norm of what ""local society likes"" and sees as correct. Man or women I would recommend him to either, my one regret is that I didn't find him sooner.

As stated prior, in my 17 years of law enforcement I have had cases with many lawyers in all aspect of the law, criminal, civil, family, etc. During my career I always knew that should I, or my family be in a situation requiring the best trial lawyer there would never be a second thought about who to retain, that person being John Painter. 
I have had thousands of cases with many lawyers over the years. When I was a young officer and throughout my career 
John Painter taught me a lot about trail law, court precedent, N.C. and U.S. Supreme Court Rulings, as well as court room etiquette. John Painter at times would talk to me after a trial and tell me what I could have done a little better and or what I may have over looked. I know well beyond on a reasonable doubt and after being on the stand and cross examined by John Painter many times that he represented his clients with fierce fervor, dedication, commitment, and always with the best interest of his clients in mind. I say all this as both a private citizen and a prior 17 year law enforcement officer. Moreover, I also know that every law enforcement officer holds John Pinter in high regard and carries a healthy deserved respect for him as a person and lawyer. Many officers may not like me saying this, however I personally and professionally know that all officers have a healthy fear of him trying their cases. John Painter is highly educated in the law, to a degree well beyond the average lawyer. I can't state it enough that he is the best trail lawyer around. Again, during my career I was field training officer for all new officers. I also had a section of instruction and discussion on how to prepare case files, evidence collection, chain of custody, completeness and accuracy in report writing and note taking, and simply doing things the right way. And I always referred to prior cases I had with John Painter as well cases I observed that other officers had with John Painter. Simply put, John Painter is the most qualified, educated, experienced, honest lawyer I am aware of. Yes there are other great lawyers in Union County all of whom I also know personally and professionally. With that being said I highly recommend John Painter if you find yourself in need of the best lawyer, and once again this comes from both being a client of John Painter and also a 17 year career as law enforcement officer. So I feel I have an insight as to John Painter's ability, experience, honesty, and education representing clients and especially trial law. You will not be disappointed, unless you decide not to at least consult with John Painter. And of course a disclaimer, I was not asked nor obligated to write a review, especially this lengthy of a review regarding John Painter. I write this out of my own free will and respect for John Painter as a person and a lawyer. Being a law enforcement officer I am always asked who is the best lawyer, and number one on my list is John Painter. If I retained him, would refer my mom and family members to him, I highly recommend that whom ever reads this review to do the same.",5,"Mr. painter has helped me with traffic violations and other tickets.

There are many $89 bankruptcy ads on google as soon as you start looking, however you soon learn that the pasture is not so green on the other side.  Having to do all the paperwork yourself is not only extremely stressful, but also poses a much higher risk of an unsuccessful filing.   John's rates were clearly stated up front and I was very happy with the total cost of filing.  To have a superhero with a great reputation on your side doing all of your work for you is priceless.

Another positive experience I had was that I mistakenly gave John the wrong phone number and address for a creditor.  John and his team promptly contacted me and remedied the situation.  These quick feedback loops and constant communication gave me comfort knowing that things were moving along and if there was a snag, I was notified soon there after.

My case and charges are not the ordinary and offer a unique set of challenges.  I compounded the difficulty to appeal my case due to my pro se representation at the first trial.  During my first meeting with Mr. Mosser, it was obvious that he had prepared for our consultation as he was well versed in my case and status. He spoke frankly and clearly with me about my options. In addition to laying out the potential outcomes from an Appeal, he also reviewed a fair fee structure which was very reasonable.

 Mr. Mosser did not waste any time in getting my appeal filed and keeps me fully informed every step of the way.  It continues to be refreshing that he is very knowledgeable in Appellate Court process and procedure which helps to levelset the expectations involved in overturning my guilty sentence.  

As my case continues in the higher courts, Mr. Mosser continues to be fully entrenched in my innocence and I feel very lucky to have such strong representation.  His knowledge, professionalism and determination for a successful outcome are nothing short of impressive.  I highly recommend Mr. Todd Mosser to anyone looking for a great Appeals Attorney.

For more than two decades,  my practice has focused on middle market clients who face the same complex set of issues and challenges to business, growth and transition as their larger counterparts but without the benefit of a professional board of directors or the expansive infrastructure support enjoyed by larger enterprises. These are the clients whom I believe can most benefit from my efforts.  I have steered these middle market companies and, in some cases, their individual shareholders or founding entrepreneurs through major and defining business transactions and moments, including a multitude of stock and asset  mergers, sales and acquisitions on both buyer and seller side, simple and complex shareholder disputes, e-business launches, major and complex third party contract drafting, negotiations and terminations, business divorces, multi-generational successions and many other growing pain events  that can sometimes make or break the middle market business.

Chang is a trial attorney with Panish Shea & Boyle LLP and focuses her practice representing plaintiffs in complex catastrophic injury, wrongful death, and product liability cases. She and her trial teams have obtained some of the largest verdicts on record including a recent $160.5 million jury verdict for a man who suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of a vicious beating by security personnel for a nightclub, the two largest wrongful death verdicts in California in 2014, and four of the top 25 verdicts in California in both 2014 and 2015 ‚Äì including the largest verdicts received in North County, San Diego (Vista) and Imperial County (El Centro).

Additional recoveries obtained by Ms. Chang include a landmark $32,500,000 settlement on behalf of two clients who were catastrophically injured and two clients whose father was killed in two collisions on Loma Vista Drive in Beverly Hills, California, and a $17 million jury verdict for the mother of Cameron Cuthbertson, a visually impaired man who was crushed to death by a Los Angeles County Blue Line train after he stepped into the gap between rail cars, mistaking the opening for the door. Although Mr. Cuthbertson was able to get up after his fall and climb halfway back onto the platform, the train began to move, resulting in his death. At the time of Mr. Cuthbertson's death, the Blue Line was the only Metro line without protective barriers between rail cars, and the evidence at trial demonstrated that the MTA was well aware of the serious risk that the unprotected gaps between cars posed to the public, and, in particular, the visually impaired. Immediately following this incident, barriers were installed in front of the gaps between all Blue Line rail cars.

Ms. Chang has been named by the Daily Journal as one of the Top 100 Lawyers in California for 2017, one of the Top Plaintiff Lawyers in California for 2017, and as one of the Top Women Lawyers in California for 2016 and 2017. She is the 2014 recipient of the Consumer Attorneys of California (""CAOC"") Consumer Attorney of the Year Award, and was a finalist for the award in 2017, 2016 and 2012. She is member of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA) and serves on the Executive Committee, and is a National Board Member. Ms. Chang is also on the Executive Committee (2nd Vice President) of the Consumer Attorneys of California (CAOC), and served as Education Chair for 2017.  She is a frequent speaker on various legal issues including demonstrative evidence at trial and is listed in Best Lawyers in America and Super Lawyers for Southern California.

Throughout her career, Ms. Chang has dedicated herself to serve as a mentor to other female trial lawyers. In 2017, the Consumer Attorneys of California's Women's Caucus honored Ms. Chang for her outstanding commitment to furthering the education and careers of women trial lawyers by presenting her with its Consumer Advocate of the Year Award.

For the past twenty years, Ms. Chang has represented both plaintiffs and defendants throughout the country in products liability, commercial litigation, professional liability, securities fraud, and complex torts cases. She has served as local, regional, and national counsel for a variety of companies and manufacturers. She has also argued numerous times in the Connecticut Supreme and Appellate Courts, and was appointed by the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court to serve on the Connecticut Appellate Advisory Rules Committee.

During her practice, Ms. Chang has been recognized for her involvement in landmark cases. She was selected by the American Bar Association's Young Lawyer's Division as one of the ""20 Young Lawyers Whose Work Makes a Difference"" for bringing the first civil rights class action on behalf of prisoners with AIDS in a maximum security prison. The class action resulted in a landmark settlement that was cited with approval by the 1991 Report to the President and Senate by the National Commission on AIDS, and resulted in the formulation of model policies and procedures relating to the housing, programming and medical treatment of prisoners with AIDS currently used in prisons throughout the country. Ms. Chang thereafter drafted and lobbied for enacted legislation in Connecticut relating to the release of terminally ill prisoners on medical parole, and she proposed and instituted the first national scholarship fund with the Stewart B. McKinney Foundation for individuals pursuing a medical or nursing degree to work with patients with AIDS. For this work, she was the recipient of numerous national awards.

In 1996, Ms. Chang brought the first lawsuit in the country based on the newly enacted Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 13981 (VAWA). As part of that lawsuit, Ms. Chang successfully argued for the upholding of the constitutionality of the statute in the first federal court to consider the issue. After reaching a settlement in the case, she lectured extensively on the issue of gender-motivated violence. She was a guest commentator on several national television shows regarding the statute, both before and after the United States Supreme Court eventually ruled that the civil remedy portion of the statute was unconstitutional.

Ryan was taught by his father, a prosecutor and Baptist preacher, to practice humility, protect the vulnerable, and to have passion for justice. Ryan joins his father and also his brother, who has served as Floyd County's Commonwealth's Attorney since 2000, in believing that juries are the most powerful safeguard against greed, danger, and evil. Ryan chose to focus his legal practice in the civil, rather than the criminal, justice system as a means of making communities safe. When you work with Ryan, you work with an idealist ‚Äì someone who believes in his cause. It is this conviction that gives him the energy and raw sincerity necessary to fight the good fight, especially if that means taking your case to a jury

In an effort to seek excellence, Ryan has always dedicated his law practice 100% to victims of negligence. Moreover, having trained in some of Kentucky's preeminent personal injury law firms, Ryan has a deep understanding of what it takes to successfully represent the vulnerable against increasingly callous and hostile corporations. For that reason, he is able to bring a deep and sophisticated level of insight to modern personal litigation and trial practice. Personal injury litigation is an ever-evolving field, as attitudes, perceptions, and insurance tactics constantly change. By limiting his practice to personal injury claims only, Ryan is able to stay ahead of defense strategies that seek to obscure the truth.

Ryan's practice focuses on personal injury and wrongful death litigation and trial practice, including: motor vehicle wrecks; tractor trailer wrecks; motorcycle wrecks; pedestrian injuries; defective vehicles, including sudden acceleration and airbag defects; defective medical devices; premises liability; general negligence; uninsured and underinsured motorist claims; and, bad faith claims. Ryan handles cases as many in Ohio as he does in Kentucky and is able to balance his practice in multiple jurisdictions by following closely the constant changes in the law and pending legislation in the state capitals.

Having tried multiple cases to verdict, Ryan is able to bring years of trial experience into his evaluation of every case that comes into the office. Having clerked for the Supreme Court of Kentucky, Ryan is able to construct a trial strategy that will withstand the appeals process. With a reputation as a attorney who can and will try your case, Ryan is often able to reach successful settlements of his client's case without the necessity of a jury trial. Over the years, he has handled relatively small cases in addition to multi-million dollar cases involving catastrophic injury. Above all, Ryan enjoys working with families who genuinely need help. In Kentucky, he was able to obtain one of the largest jury verdicts of its kind on record. In Ohio, he has one of the the largest settlements of its kind on record. Ryan prides himself on constant client communication and the close relationships he forms in the litigation process.

When not at work, Ryan enjoys spending time with his wife and children. He enjoys running and weight-lifting, and he and his family attend Crossroads in Florence.",15333066478531.jpeg,http://www.dallasandturner.com,,,Calvin,,,39.0029144,-84.6240113,Personal Injury Law,5,james-ryan-turner,2,0,"I had an awesome experience with this firm!

His primary focus is complex medical malpractice defense and general litigation. He has successfully tried many cases before state and federal juries to favorable resolutions, as well as before numerous administrative boards and tribunals.
?
Born and raised in Northern California, shortly after completing college he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 1979.

For the latter law firm, Mr. Rohl was recruited and hired on a plane coming back from a deposition where he destroyed an expert witness.

11094,amy_tobias,Amy,Tobias,amy_tobias@yopmail.com,LOD@!@#456,"Manassas, VA 20110, USA",VA,"Amy Tobias was born in Florida and raised in Georgia and Kentucky. She spent her undergraduate days in Chicago and summers in New York City where her parents resided. Amy settled in Virginia in 2004. She graduated from Northwestern University in 2001 with a degree in Communications. After taking a legal argument class in her sophomore year in college, while officially an acting major, Amy discovered she had a passion to ""argue the law"".
Wanting to come back East, Amy attended the Washington College of Law at American University in Washington, D.C. and graduated cum laude in 2004. In her final year of law school, Amy served as President of the Moot Court Honor Society and received the Stephen Wermiel Award for service to Moot Court, in addition to the Outstanding Graduate Award at graduation.

Upon entering law school, Amy's goal was to be a prosecutor. However, after she clerked at the Montgomery County State's Attorney's Office during law school, she realized talented and determined prosecutors were abundant, but defendants didn't always receive adequate and qualified representation. Believing in the importance of justice and fairness in our legal process, she decided her skills would best serve the accused by being a part of the process facilitating a fair trial.

After graduating from law school, Amy had the opportunity to clerk for the Judges in the Arlington County Circuit Court. This experience solidified her desire to practice criminal defense. Following her clerkship, Amy joined the newly-established Office of the Public Defender in Arlington County as one of its first hired attorneys.

After working for the Public Defender's Office, Amy entered private practice. She focused on criminal defense, family law and personal injury. In 2009, Amy moved her practice to Prince William County when she joined the Manassas Law Group. Since then, she has continued to represent parties in criminal, family law and personal injury matters in Prince William County as well as Fairfax, Fauquier, and Loudoun counties.

In 2015, Amy established Tobias Law PLLC in Manassas, a solo practice, bringing along her legal assistant of 6 years, Dawn. Within the first year, Amy hired Claire Salitsky, Esq. as her associate attorney and continued to build a practice dedicated to her clients by thorough preparation and strategy.

Amy continues to represent defendants in criminal cases - from traffic matters and misdemeanors to felony cases such as theft, drug offenses and sexual offenses. Defending the accused is still her passion and drives her to pursue every avenue of defense to ensure a fair result for her clients.

Amy has practiced extensively in the area of family law handling adoptions, divorces, custody and visitation matters, support matters, protective orders, and abuse and neglect cases. Serving the families of Prince William County has been a great honor. It takes a certain kind of person to practice family law, someone who can advise and counsel as well as advocate for and defend clients and their families. It requires a delicate balance and one that Amy has perfected over many years, making her extremely knowledgeable and effective for her clients.

As part of her family law practice, Amy has handled appeals to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. In Craig v. Craig, Amy successfully defended the ruling of the Circuit Court in favor of her client regarding the division of a civil federal pension. In this published opinion by the Court of Appeals, her position regarding the underlying legal issue was upheld and an important ruling on attorney's fees in post-divorce litigation was given. In Gregory v. Gregory, Amy successfully appealed a decision by the Circuit Court in which her client was required to pay spousal support and keep all of the debt and divide his retirement with his wife. The Court of Appeals found that the Circuit Court's findings were inconsistent with its rulings and overturned the case granting a new trial in the Circuit Court.

Amy has handled many car accident cases as well as dog bite cases and injury cases on the property of third parties. It is the goal of an insurance company to settle a case for as little as possible, sometimes resulting in the injured party receiving far less than they need or deserve. Amy strives to maximize her clients' recovery and advises her clients throughout the process about the best course of action to receive the best result.

Amy is a member of the Prince William County Bar Association and served as its President in 2014. Amy served on the Prince William County Bar Foundation Board in 2013 and 2015. She is also a member of the Fairfax County Bar Association, the Virginia Women's Attorney Association and the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association.

Amy lives in Haymarket, Virginia with her husband and two boys. Having declared at the early age of 7 that she wanted to be a ""lawyer during the day and a star at night"", she is fulfilling that dream as the lead singer of Eddie's Mom Band, a local cover band that plays at numerous venues in Northern Virginia.",15362649093769.jpeg,http://www.northvalaw.com,,,,Carolyn Jenkins ,,38.7657182,-77.4811474,Family and Divorce Law,5,amy-tobias,1,0,,5,"Mrs. Tobias is one of the best Attorney's in the world!

About Cindy 
 
I am a Personal Injury Trial Attorney.  Since being admitted to practice law in the State of Florida, I have focused my practice on representing individuals injured due to the negligence of others.  The cases I handle include representing individuals injured in Car Accidents, Slip and Falls, Trip and Falls, Negligent Security, General Negligence matters, and Wrongful Death matters.  I handle these cases on a contingnecy basis which means my clients do not owe me a fee unless I make them a recovery.  I have a background of roughly 13 years in the Personal Injury field, having worked my way through undergraduate school, as well as law school, working at a Plaintiff's Personal Injury firm in South Florida. Indeed, I have experience working on every aspect of a personal injury case, from the very begining all the way through trial.   
 
In addition to my personal injury practice, I represent homeowners in property insurance disputes against their homeowner's insurance throughout the State of Florida. ",,https://www.daneridiez.com,,,,,,25.8666296,-80.1933038,Personal Injury Law,5,cindy-diez,1,0,,5,,5,,5,0,sub_DjNxgKcHy5BXbs

Savoy has helped divorcing parties get the best possible result, inside the courtroom and out. She is fully committed to solving her client's problems.  Her work is typified by a diligence in the pursuit of what the client believes is in his or her best interest.  

She prides herself on practicing law with high ethical standards and her track record demonstrates her uncanny ability to receive and maintain the trust of her clients. In the world of family law, trust is key ‚Äì and few understand that better than Cassandra.  Divorce clients divulge their most confidential information, which means establishing trust is paramount to achieving a positive result for all. A large part of building that trust is by word of mouth ‚Äì 50% of her business is obtained through referral.  

One statistic that helps give our clients some calm and peace of mind: 98% of divorce cases in New Jersey will end without a trial.  Cassandra is able to settle cases largely because she understands the nuances of the law and the art of compromise without capitulation. Often the law is not as black and white as much as it is gray. Understanding the nuance is a crucial part of her ability to help clients see the benefit of a bargain and to getting the other side to compromise. She can help clients find creative ways to look at the facts and circumstances. One of her primary goals is to get parties to find amicable solutions that are lasting and prevents the need to litigate and re-litigate, and re-litigate their cases after the divorce.

Cassandra is proud to work as an attorney-mediator. The best part of the program is that through mediation, she helps the parties create their own best outcome! Mediation proceeds much faster than litigation saving the parties both time and money, and most importantly, saves them stress and anxiety. Significantly, when the parties complete mediation, they each have a plan for life after-divorce because they have created a parenting plan that puts the children first, and, a budget made in consultation with an accountant. Most importantly, each party completes mediation with dignity in tact. As the result of mediation, even parties who may not want to divorce their spouse, end the marriage experiencing far less stress and knowing that tomorrow will be a brighter day.

We were referred to Mr. Toscano by a family friend. He took on our case with the many challenges it faced. This case dragged on for almost three years but Mr. Toscano was always positive.
